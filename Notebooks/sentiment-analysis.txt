The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.

Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes.

In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.

I laughed. Often. At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny.", "Sentiment": "POSITIVE", "P(positive)": 0.8813101649284363, "P(negative)": 0.010161685757339, "P(neutral)": 0.03649246692657471, "P(mixed)": 0.07203567028045654}, "38": {"ReviewText": "I enjoyed the first season a lot.

Not since Arrested Development has a sitcom been this truly hysterical and quick paced that you don't know what to expect next.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, originally premiering on the FX network in 2005, revolves around four friends: Charlie (Charlie Day), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), and his sister Dee (Kaitlin Olson); all of whom own and run an Irish bar in downtown Philadelphia.  They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement, ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer.  Yes, there's nothing really wholly original about the show's premise, but it remains hysterically funny throughout.  The second season of the show finds Danny DeVito joining the cast as Dennis and Dee's father, who isn't the sanest of the bunch either.
